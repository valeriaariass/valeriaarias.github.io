        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Valeria Arias. I am a 2nd year student, majoring in Liberal Studies. I am set to graduate in 2026. I hope to one day be able to use my degree to be able to teach in schools, and be that teacher that I always wanted growing up. I graduated from Bloomington high school in 2022 in Fontana, California. I spent the majority of my childhood growing up here in Riverside, and I just adore my city. Coming to UCR to further my education was a no brainer for me.
<br><br>

         I am currently working towards gaining more professional experience as I go through college, and plan to get a summer job as a student teaching assistant. I worked my first job during my first year and a half in college, which took place at a retail store. I worked there as a cashier and fitting room attendant. Working here for as long as I did really showed me how the whole business of the customer service world really works. This allowed me to learn how to meet the needs of customers and to be quick and efficient with limited time frames. It taught me how to be responsible for myself, in managing my own money and only depending on myself. This was the best first job I could have ever had, and it taught me alot about endurance, even if it meant doing things I did not want to do. Sometimes I had to deal with rude customers, or with people stealing, but thatâ€™s mainly what people have to deal with working at any sort of retail job. It gave me the strength to endure and work so I could have better opportunities in the future, and not be glued to low level jobs because I didnâ€™t try to get experience elsewhere. After I felt like I had learned enough, the job and I just werenâ€™t a great fit, so I decided to quit to see where else life would take me.
<br><br>

        Over this past summer, I was able to get a job at a childrenâ€™s library. This was a really great experience, and allowed me to get a feel of what working with children is like. This can be helpful for my future career as a teacher, because it allowed me to gauge what my future could look like. I was able to do daily readings with them, conduct craft activities, and learned the processes of how checking books in and out was like. I had always wanted to work at a library, and being able to do it for a short summer was like a dream come true. It allowed me to be creative, and be able to go home and brainstorm ideas for library activities for the kids. This made me dream what my future life could be like with making lesson plans for my classroom, only this time it wouldnâ€™t be for one summer, but for the rest of my life.
